  The life cycle of *Ascaris* worms begins when adult worms reside in the small intestine of humans. In this environment, female worms—which are generally larger than males—can produce approximately 200,000 eggs per day. These eggs are passed out of the body through the stool. Only fertilized eggs are capable of causing infection. Once excreted, the fertilized eggs require specific environmental conditions to develop; they mature best in moist, warm, and shaded soil.
  People typically become infected by accidentally ingesting these eggs, often through food that has been in contact with soil contaminated by human feces containing fertilized *Ascaris* eggs. After ingestion, the eggs hatch in the small intestine, releasing larvae. These larvae then penetrate the intestinal wall and travel via the lymphatic system and bloodstream to the lungs. Within the lungs, the larvae enter the air sacs (alveoli), migrate up the respiratory tract to the throat, and are subsequently swallowed. Once back in the small intestine, the larvae mature into adult worms, completing the life cycle.

Humans become infected primarily through the accidental ingestion of these eggs, often via contaminated food, water, or hands. Once ingested, the eggs hatch in the small intestine, releasing oncospheres. These oncospheres penetrate the intestinal villi and develop into cysticercoid larvae within the tissue.
  As the larvae mature, they return to the intestinal lumen, where they evaginate their scoleces and attach themselves to the intestinal mucosa, particularly in the ileum, a section of the small intestine. There, they develop into adult worms. The adult worms release eggs through gravid proglottids, which are either excreted in the stool or may cause autoinfection within the same host. In cases of autoinfection, the eggs hatch internally, allowing the parasite to complete its life cycle without leaving the host’s body. This mechanism enables the infection to persist for extended periods, sometimes lasting for years.

Once inside the arthropod, the eggs hatch, and the resulting oncospheres penetrate the intestinal wall, developing into cysticercoid larvae within the insect’s body.
  Humans or rodents may become infected by accidentally ingesting these infected arthropods, often through contaminated food—such as improperly stored cereals—or by exposure in infested environments. When ingested, the cysticercoid larvae are released in the stomach, where they evert their scolex (head) and attach to the intestinal wall using suckers. The worms mature into adults within approximately 20 days.
